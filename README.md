# Leetcode80-20: The 80/20 Approach

Welcome to my Leetode repository! This repository is dedicated to solving Leetdode
problems using the 80/20 principle, focusing on the 20% of problem patterns that will yield
80% of the benefits in terms of coding skills, problem-solving ability, and interview prep.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this repository is to solve key Leetcode problems across various categories
that will have the most significant impact on my understanding of data structures, 
algorithms, and coding patterns. By concentrating on these high-impact problems, 
I aim to maximize my efficiency and effectiveness in preparing for technical interviews 
and sharpening my problem-solving skills.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

The problems in this repository are organized by category, such as Arrays, Two Pointers, 
Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. Each problem is accompanied by a 
well-documented solution, including:

- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution**: The code implementation in Python.
- **Time Complexity**: An analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.
- **Approach**: An explanation of the thought process and strategies used to solve the problem.

## üìà Progress

I will be updating this repository regularly as I work through these high-impact problems.
My focus will be on quality over quantity, ensuring that I deeply understand the solutions 
and patterns that emerge from these problems.

## üß† Why the 80/20 Rule?

The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, states that 80% of the results come from 20% of the efforts.
In the context of Leetcode and coding interviews, this means that focusing on a small subset 
of the most important patterns can lead to significant improvements in problem-solving skills and 
interview readiness.

## üèÜ Achievements

- **[Milestone 1]**: Complete all key problems in Arrays and Strings.
- **[Milestone 2]**: TBD
- **[Milestone 3]**: TBD
